			<div class="h3">Thinking Like A Programmer</div>
				<p>Even though all <span class="bold">5 steps </span>are important in the lesson, I chose <span class="bold">3 steps</span> that I found very useful. The reason I chose them was 
					because I felt these steps are helping me understand coding a lot better. <br>I first coded a few years ago, but didn't 
					get very far. Now I am back with more motivation than ever to succeed!</p>

					<div class="lesson_content">
						<p><span class="bold">1. Procedural Thinking</span></p>
								Original Notes: "<span class="italic">It involves taking a problem and breaking it down into steps. Making an organized list will help.</span>"
								<p>Personally I have a huge problem over thinking things instead of just getting down to do something. Honestly I 
								just can't just start throwing some code around and expect stuff to end up how I envision it. I need to at least 
								write a simple structure of how everything will fall into place.</p>

						<p><span class="bold">2. Systematic Debugging</span></p>
								Original Notes: "<span class="italic">Ability to find the problems and figure out the possible causes of the problem. Kind of like when a new 
								computer hardware configuration doesn't work. <br>(Example: Messed up RAM in my computer)</span>"
								<p>My hobby is building and messing with computers, hardware mostly. So I don't have much experience in terms of coding. But I
								know that problems just don't arise for no reason. There is usually a real identifiable cause of the problem. Seeing 

						<p><span class="bold">3. Technological Empathy</span></p>
								Original Notes: "<span class="italic">Trying to understand how the computer sees things. Italics and boldness isn't just there automatically. HTML is key.</span>" <p>These steps are huge and critical to understanding programming. In a regular everyday conversation you may be talking and you just
								can't figure out the right term, but you can get by without getting specific. With programming, you have to be for the most part, correct 
								on your placement of anything. For example, when I try to <span class="bold"> Bold</span> a word using &lt;b&gt; I have to be careful of when to close the tag
								or else risk getting text I didn't want bold, bolded. It sucks but I'm glad the computer will do 'exactly' what I will input, instead of 
								'guessing' what I wanted to do, while losing fine tuning ability.

			<div class="h3">Three Types</div>
			<p><div class="lesson_content"><span class="bold">HTML</span>
					<p>Mostly known for the &lt;tag&gt; system using syntax and rules. These expressions provide the basic elements that DOM will read.

			<p><span class="bold">CSS</span></p>
					Determines how the page will look. Can customize background, border sizes, positions, font sizes, etc. EX. &lt; class="article"&gt;
			<p><span class="bold">DOM(Document Object Model)</span></p>
					Creates the elements in the tree like structure. Using the tags from HTML and CSS, DOM determines the elements in the tree. Simply put, DOM interacts with elements in HTML and CSS

			<div class="h3"><span class="bold">My Personalized Useful Tips For Understanding Boxes/Structure</span></div>
				<p><div class="lesson_content">There are many tips in this lesson that I thought I could easily figure out just by right clicking an image and looking at its properties. The lesson about <span class="underline">boxes</span> is very interesting
					in showing if you need to pinpoint something on the page, it's not hard at all. Practical reasons I would use it, are to figure out the font color number or even the pixel size of a certain image. 
					Possible even just understanding the structure of how many boxes are being used.

					<span class="tip">Tip</span>: A useful shortcut for <span class="underline"><span class="bold">Mozilla Firefox Inspector</span></span> to check the code out on the page. <div class="bold">CTRL + Shift + C"</div>

				<br>Using <span class="underline"><span class="bold">Mozilla Firefox Inspector</span></span> is very easy. You only have to hover over the text or background and the correct element will highlight. </div><br>

				<br><div class="line-seperator"></div>

					<p>These are some of the elements you will see on the right of the screen.</p>
					<p>I ended up clicking the tag <span class="tag_color1">&lt; id ="Banner"&gt;</span> and Rules it showed <span class="tag_color1">h1</span> as having these elements:
					<div class="databox1"><p>color: #F8981C;</p>
						<p>font-size:36px;</p>
						<p>font-family: "Courier New";</p>
						<p>padding:0px 20px;</p>
						<p>font-weight:normal;</p>
					</div>

				<p>Another perfect example with different elements was clicking an image. I wanted to find out the border size of an image.</p>
					<p>I clicked <span class="tag_color1">&lt;img src="app.png"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;</span>				<!--Geez, that was interesting to write with two tags next to each other!-->
						<div class="databox1"><p>border:4px solid#F8981C;</p>
							<p>margin:20px;</p>
						</div>
				<p>There are multiple ways to understand structure clearly. It is very easy to get lost in all of the information in a command prompt. One of the easiest, if not crucial habits to get used to is indentation. It really helps to visualize the whole structure of your code. Imagine if you had no indentation? Can't imagine? Here is an example. </p>

						<div class="databox1">
							<p>&lt;html&gt;
							<p>&lt;head&gt;
							<p>&lt;title&gt;
							<p>Title Text
							<p>&lt;/title&gt;
							<p>&lt;/head&gt;	
							<p>&lt;body&gt;
							<p>&lt;div class="code"&gt;
							<p>Content
							<p>&lt;/div&gt;
							<p>&lt;/body&gt;
							<p>&lt;/html&gt;
						</div>
				<p>You may try to convince me that it's neat that way and you can see the start tags and end tags clearly. It may be fine for maybe a few lines of code but you don't want to get a bad habit of not organizing your code. You always want to be aware what's going on in your code structure. Lets see an example how it looks better.

						<div class="databox1">
							<p>&lt;html&gt;
							<p>&lt;head&gt;
							<p><blockquote>&lt;title&gt;</blockquote>
							<p><blockquote><blockquote><span class="tag_color1"><span class="italic">Title Text</span></span></blockquote></blockquote>
							<p><blockquote>&lt;/title&gt;</blockquote>
							<p>&lt;/head&gt;
							<br>
							<br>
							<p>&lt;body&gt;
							<p><blockquote>&lt;div class="code"&gt;</blockquote>
							<p><blockquote><blockquote><span class="tag_color1"><span class="italic">Content</span></span></blockquote></blockquote>
							<p><blockquote>&lt;/div&gt;</blockquote>
							<p>&lt;/body&gt;
							<p>&lt;/html&gt;
						</div>

				<p>If you have never looked at code before, this structure looks random and scattered. But as you get to hone your coding skills, you will see that, it will make you more efficient. Organizing will not even be stressful if you start off with good habits.

			<div class="h3"><span class="bold"> The Importance of HTML & CSS Combined </span> </div>
				<div class="lesson_content">
				<p>Personally I always thought you could get very far with just learning HTML. The reality is that CSS and HTML compliment each other very well. Each has its purpose and reasons why people use them everyday, especially in web developing. 

				<p><div class="bold"><div class="underline">Benefits of HTML</div></div>
					<p><div class="bold">Easy to learn</div>
						<p>Anyone can learn HTML within a day. Even having a brief summary of how tags work can be understood by many individuals. 

					<p><div class="bold">Compatibility</div>  
						<p>What good is coding if you need special software to even see it? When you begin learning you want to be able to input data while having output. Makes sense especially if you want to share your website without errors.

					<p><div class="bold">Only Language You Need</div>
						<p>If creating a simple website is something you are interested in, HTML is all you need. You can do nearly any basic functional website will need to do with HTML alone. 

				<div class="line-seperator"></div>			

				<p><div class="underline"><div class="bold">Benefits of CSS</div></div>
					<p><div class="bold">Saves Time Coding</div>
						<p>Without a doubt, CSS real power is in the amount of time it takes to change something. Lets say you have 2 paragraphs with a certain color. It would take you 2 lines of code to change both, but with CSS you can change both with 1 line of code. It is very complex, but can save you minutes if not hours worth of time.

					<p><div class="bold">Styling</div>
						<p>The amount of features in CSS in terms of styling are immense. You are able to change practically every feature of your website with ease. You can change your website to have any color, change dimensions of boxes anywhere, or even just add a picture while controlling the size. 

					<p><div class="bold">Maintainability</div>
						<p>This benefit goes hand in hand with 'saves time coding' but it must be mentioned. When you have developed a website from the ground up, changing a bunch of similar text elements in your website, can be daunting. Especially with a website that constantly changes. CSS makes changing any feature or style effortless.

		<div class="lesson_content"> 
					<div class="bold"><div class="underline">Summary:</div></div> 

					<p>I gave a brief overview of the benefits of both languages. When combined they help to avoid <span class="underline">repetition</span>. This alone will save you time, bandwidth expenses, and helps you make changes on the fly. If you are planning to learn HTML, don't hesitate to learn CSS, since it will make coding much easier and less demanding.
